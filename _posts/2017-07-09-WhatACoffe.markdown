# Independent research by scientists worldwide continues to link coffee to significant (and surprising) healthful properties.

Coffee has a naturally complex botanical profile, with at least 1,000 natural compounds in the bean (including caffeine) and another 300 created in the roasting process. Scientists have linked a number of them, including some strong antioxidants, with a host of physiological benefits.

Research has shown that moderate coffee consumption (or 3-5 cups daily) may be associated with many positive effects, including:

Liver disease prevention
Improved cognitive function in older adults
Sharper memory
Increased athletic endurance
Reduced risk of type 2 diabetes
Longevity
Due to the increasing scientific evidence, coffee has earned a new – and improved – reputation. The latest U.S. Dietary Guidelines recently made an unprecedented recommendation for coffee as part of a healthy lifestyle.
